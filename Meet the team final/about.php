                <p>Hello, I’m Chace and I’ve come from London to study Digital Media Design at Bournemouth University. I’ve chosen this course due to the diverse range of resource and learning it has to offer. I believe this course is the ideal platform for me to understand what part of design I enjoy most and that it will take me one step closer to achieving my dream of becoming successful designer. My current Unit has asked me to collaborate with other members of the course in order to create a web app. Over the next few weeks, I will be working with them closely in order to achieve our goals of building a successful web app.</p>

                <p>Hey there, I’m Verity, a level C Digital Media Design student studying at Bournemouth University. I have a keen interest in Video Games (both as a hobby and the design aspect) with a particular love for the Legend of Zelda series. Whilst studying at university, I have a part time job working as a Sales Assistant at GAME. I love anything with a fantasy theme and greatly enjoy producing creative content such as writing or illustrations. I also enjoy coding (with a preference for front-end design) and have enjoyed working on this project with my team mates!</p>

                <p>Hey there, I’m Kyle and I’m studying Digital Media Design at Bournemouth University. I am interested in most sides of the media, this includes; film, television, video games and, of course, digital media, the thing that interests me with all of these is the amount of unseen work that goes into the product and the possibilities of what these forms of media may one day become and I cannot wait to be a part of it. Over the next few weeks I will be working with Chase and Verity to create a web app, this is my first chance at doing anything like this so I’m looking forward to it and I hope it goes well.</p>
